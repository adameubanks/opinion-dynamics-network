# Opinion Dynamics Network - GitHub Pages Version

An interactive opinion dynamics simulation that demonstrates how social media posts influence group opinions in real-time. This is the GitHub Pages version that uses preselected responses instead of AI analysis.

## 🍍 The Pineapple Pizza Debate

Watch as opinions shift and evolve across a network as agents reinforce ties with those they agree with and drift from those they don't. Your goal is to try to steer the crowd toward a consensus on the age-old debate: does pineapple belong on pizza?

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Choose Your Opinion**: Select from a variety of preselected responses that range from strongly against to strongly for pineapple on pizza
2. **Post Your Opinion**: Click "Post Opinion" to add your voice to the network
3. **Watch the Network**: See how your opinion influences the network and how other agents respond
4. **Control the Simulation**: Use the play/pause and reset buttons to control the simulation

## 🔬 Why It Matters

Behind the fun is real research on how bots and AI-powered influencers can sway public opinion, fueling unity, polarization, or manipulation. This simulation demonstrates the principles of opinion dynamics in social networks.
