This project attempts to visualize how opinion dynamics change based on a users post. Currently, it uses tkinter to display a graph of the opinion dynamics (whether or not cat ladies like pineapple on pizza) with a chat where a user can make posts to this cat lady group for or against pineapple on pizza. The idea is the the posts will polarize the group more and more.

To demonstrate how this works, we want to make a more robust, linux-based UI where a user can see in a beautifully aesthetic graph showing how their posts affect the group in real time. The goal of this project is to elegantly display the results from the backend of this project.

Also, very important, but all your code should be concise and contain few (if any) comments.
